\title{Detect differences between groups}
\usage{
detect_differences(X, design, data_description, d0, s0, group_locations,
  comparison)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a numerical matrix that contains the log intensity values. Missing
data has to be encoded as 0}

\item{design}{a design matrix that has as many columns as conditions
and as many rows as samples (i.e. columns) in X. If a sample belongs
to a condition it has value 1, if not the matrix contains a 0.}

\item{data_description}{a dataframe with a `Condition` factor column which 
assign each column of \code{X} to a condition}

\item{d0}{estimated degrees of freedom of the variance moderation prior. Can be found
using \code{estimate_variance_moderation}}

\item{s0}{estimated variance of the variance moderation prior. Can be found
using \code{estimate_variance_moderation}}
}
\description{
Perform moderated t-test on the MLE group means
}
