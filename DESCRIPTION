Description: Find significantly differentially detected proteins in LFQ Mass Spec data
   This package provides the implementation of an algorithm to find significant proteins in LFQ data,
   even if the data has lots of missing values (i.e. zeros) and only a small number of replicates.
   It works on the basic assumption that low intensity values are more likely to be missing. It thus
   can infer condition wise means and enable statistical tests to find differentially detected proteins.
